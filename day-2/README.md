# Generalized Additive Models; a data-driven approach to estimating regression models

## Tuesday

* How do GAMs work?
* What are splines?
* How do GAMs learn from data without overfitting?

Weâ€™ll dig under the hood a bit to understand how GAMs work at a practical level and how to use the mgcv and gratia packages to estimate GAMs and visualise them.
